<p>
I spent my first 20 years growing up in the City of Gosnells and have been here again for the last five. I am married, have grown children and was a career academic – in the fields of politics and applied policy.  My last ten years of university employment were spent at the Institute for Sustainability and Technology Policy at Murdoch researching and teaching postgraduate courses in city planning and development theory. Though retired, I continue to write and have become a small-scale land developer.
