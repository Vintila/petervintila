<p>As far as is possible I have tried to couple my life as an academic, writer and teacher of politics with community activism.  This has meant choosing research projects or designing courses that work in the service of community values in the broadest sense: social and environmental justice, equality and inclusion, civic responsibility, democracy and internationalism.</p>
<p>These values continue to inform my thinking and writing  today and I worry especially about problems of climate change  and the planning of our cities. Now as never before they are subject to the destabilising forces of global economic competition – forces that undermine capacities to govern anything, local or global. It’s  a hard world for that ancient institution called the state and we  scorn it to our great peril.  A crowded and complex world needs good governance – at all levels!</p>
<p>Most of my work over the past three or so decades is recorded on this website and some of it reproduced.   At the moment I am at work on a book discussing the future of suburban Perth and  a small land development project in Maddington, one of Perth’s middle suburbs  The project upper most in my mind at the moment is my bid for a City of Gosnells Council seat. So if it concerns you, take a look around the website. </p>
